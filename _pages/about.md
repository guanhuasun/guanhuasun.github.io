I'm a PhD candidate at the math department of [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html), advised by [Daniel Forger](https://websites.umich.edu/~forger/) and co-advised by [Brendon Watson](https://sites.google.com/view/watsonlab/home). Before coming to Ann Arbor, I graduated from [New York University](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) with a major in math and a minor in physics. Before that, I grew up in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.
