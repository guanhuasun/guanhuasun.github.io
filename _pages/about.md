I'm a PhD candidate at the math department of [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/GraduateStudentHandbook/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html), advised by [Daniel Forger](https://websites.umich.edu/~forger/) and co-advised by [Brendon Watson](https://sites.google.com/view/watsonlab/home). Before coming to Ann Arbor, I graduated from [New York University](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/) with a major in math and a minor in physics. Before that, I grew up in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. 

Interests
======
I have a general interest in math biology with a theme of modeling and simulation. My current research focuses on large-scale simulation of the mouse brain, where I use advanced computational techniques to explore how network connectivity influences the behavior of the network as a whole. I have also researched about fluid-structure interaction problems in physiology. 

Besides research, Iâ€™m the co-founder of Veritas China(2015-), the largest student-run non-profit organization that aims to promote liberal arts education in China.

Job Market
======
I plan to graduate in Spring/Summer 2025 and I'm currently looking for a postdoctoral position in mathematics or neuroscience.
